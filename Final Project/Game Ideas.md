## Mechanic Ideas

### Mobile based, preffer single touch controls / swipe

***Multifunctional verbs!!***
- single touch fires + changes direction
- swipe moves + jumps
- Moving also attacks
- Moving pushes + pulls "Grapling hook"

Mario Odissey rip-off ideas
- "Chain Chomp", push and release, advance **favorite**
- "Bullet Bill", unstopable player, navigate
- "Uproot", hold to strech, jump over stuff
- "Coin Coffer", shoot stuff, handle ammo
- "RC Car", top-down racing, race **favorite**
- "Sherm", tank shooting, shoot

Mario Party rip-off ideas
- "Candy Shakedown", move and shake phone, get stuff through
- "Fetch Quest", move and grab stuff, cooperative multiplayer *complicate*
- "Rowboat Uprising", row-boat simulator, dodge stuff
- "Trip Navigator", wall around in maze, little info
- "Just for Kicks", mini-soccer, arcade simple soccer **favorite**
- "Perfect Fit", rotate 3D pieces, volumetric puzzle **favorite**
- "Train in Pain", limited move, hit stuff
- "Sizzling Stakes", rotate 3D pieces, volumetric action **favorite**
- "Dash and Dine", action-juggling, mini-overcooked *complicate, but like the idea*

## Concept Ideas

Nier: Automata
- OS Chip management, add and remove chips, juggle functions *maybe over the scope*

Dead Space
- Dismemberment, break stuff down to pieces, strategic aiming *needs to be very simplified, but doable*

Mario Maker
- Level generation, create and share levels, social play *maybe WAY over the scope*

Half-Life
- Gravity gun, push and pull objects, volumetric action

Various Games
- New Game plus, end the level/game, run again but more difficult
  *steak based play? There's only one level type game?*

Shadow of Mordor
- Nemesis system, game keeps track of what's happened, taunts player/ alters gameplay
  *doable if simplified, could be placed on top of other mechanics*

Solitarica
- Mechanics based around already known analog games
  *Solitarica is based out of Solitaire, but we could do blackjack, yatzee, stuff like that*

FEZ / Paper Mario
 - Changing perspective (2D to 3D, 2D plane)
